A drop-in replacement for the re module.

It uses RE2 under the hood, of course, so various PCRE features
(e.g. backreferences, look-around assertions) are not supported.

Known differences between this API and the re module's API:

  * The error class does not provide any error information as attributes.
  * The Options class replaces the re module's flags with RE2's options as
    gettable/settable properties. Please see re2.h for their documentation.
  * The pattern string and the input string do not have to be the same type.
    Any Text (unicode in Python 2, str in Python 3) will be encoded to UTF-8.
  * The pattern string cannot be Text if the options specify Latin-1 encoding.

Known issues with regard to building the C++ extension:

  * Building requires RE2 to be installed on your system.
    On Debian, for example, install the libre2-dev package.
  * Building requires pybind11 to be installed on your system OR venv.
    On Debian, for example, install the pybind11-dev package.
    For a venv, install the pybind11 package from PyPI.
  * Building on macOS has not been tested yet and will possibly fail.
  * Building on Windows has not been tested yet and will probably fail.
