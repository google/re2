      "message": "Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but the way this works is that `AddRangeFlags` will call `AddFoldedRange`, and `AddFoldedRange` has the terminate-prematurely behavior in case something is already present.\n\nTherefore, this fix works around this problem by making an entirely new `CharClassBuilder`, which has no pre-existing ranges in it, and therefore prevents `AddFoldedRange` from terminating prematurely. This entire `CharClassBuilder` is then added to the one we\u0027re trying to build up on line 1172, hence avoiding the non-inclusion of the characters we wanted to include?\n\nAssuming that is correct, are there any remaining cases where the desired behavior of `AddFoldedRange` terminating prematurely is desired? I ask because best I can tell there are only 2 call-sites for `AddFoldedRange`: in `AddRangeFlags` and in `AddFoldedRange` recursively, and this change eliminates the behavior for the former -- do we need it in the latter?",
