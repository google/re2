It looks like a partial sentence to me, did something get cut off?\n\nAre you trying to say that per the documentation, the header should match the regex\n\n```\n^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\\.$\n```\n\nwhich is published at that URL?\n\nAlso, this documentation says \"should\" not \"must\". What are the consequences for not merging this?",

      "message": "Yes, you are correct. I updated the CL message to make it more clear.\n\nThis change implements the convention for the generated code header agreed upon https://go.dev/s/generatedcode. The convention was reached in 2018 through the proposal https://go.dev/issues/13560. By now, most of the generated Go code uses a comment that matches the regexp `^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\\.$`.\n\nMost of the source files in the Go language repo adhere to this convention for consistency. E.g., see these CLs: [runtime/internal/sys: use standard generated code header](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/60250), [cmd/dist: use standard generated code header](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/61010), [cmd/cgo: use standard generated code comment](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/115035).\n\n`mksyntaxgo` is used to generate the file https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.1/src/regexp/syntax/doc.go and should follow comment rules for generated files. Because a lot of tools rely on this fact.\n\nNot merging this CL won\u0027t break the code. It is more about maintaining standards, ensuring consistency, and improving developer experience.",
