      "message": "I believe I have figured out how to get some of the type checking to run, although we *won\u0027t* get as deep coverage as we would if we painstakingly added type annotations. As maintainer, I absolutely believe you are within your rights to reject the addition `-\u003e None` to every method. However, I want to make it clear that *should* we ever extend the API and its types, we *may* introduce some errors, which might be caught if we added `-\u003e None` to literally every test method in `re2_test.py` as in the first iteration of this change. However, since the re2 python API is explicitly *not* something that is likely to change in the future, I think we are probably safe to avoid that. But I am pretty confident that we *are* missing some \"test coverage\" of our type annotations by not annotating most of `re2_test.py`. I am totally fine with that if you are.",
