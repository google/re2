# Abseil requires C++14 at minimum.
# Previously, the flag was set via `BAZEL_CXXOPTS`. On macOS, we also had to set
# `BAZEL_USE_CPP_ONLY_TOOLCHAIN` since Bazel wouldn't respect the former without
# the latter. However, the latter stopped Bazel from using Xcode and `-framework
# Foundation`, which CCTZ (vendored into Abseil) requires.
