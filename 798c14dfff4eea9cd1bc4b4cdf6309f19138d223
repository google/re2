I ask because [this](https://github.com/google/maxtext/pull/686) PR is arguably innocuous, but [this](https://github.com/google/re2/pull/497) PR and [this](https://github.com/google/re2/pull/498) PR are extremely dubious. The timing might just be a coincidence, but the thing is that it might ***not*** just be a coincidence. I guess I will never know. :)",
